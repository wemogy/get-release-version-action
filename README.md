# ![wemogy logo](https://wemogyimages.blob.core.windows.net/logos/wemogy-github-tiny.png) Get Release Version (GitHub Action)

A GitHub Action to determine the next version by checking the commit history for [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

## Usage

```yaml
- name: Clone repository
  uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0
    fetch-tags: true
    ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
- uses: wemogy/get-release-version-action@v1
  id: get-release-version
  with:
    suffix: ""
    only-increase-suffix: "false"

- run: echo ${{ steps.get-release-version.outputs.version }}
- run: echo ${{ steps.get-release-version.outputs.has-changes }}
```

## Inputs

| Input                  | Description                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `suffix`               | The suffix to append to the version (e.g. `hotfix`).                                 |
| `only-increase-suffix` | If set to `true`, even if changes got detected, only the suffix will be incremented. |
| `create-tag`           | Create a Git Tag for the version. Will be pushed, if remote is available.            |

## Outputs

| Output        | Description                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `version`     | The version to use for the release.                                                                    |
| `has-changes` | Determines, if changes got detected, which require a version change according to Conventional Commits. |

## Testing

1. Create a GitHub repository with a default branch (eg. by creating a README.md).
2. Create a `.test.env` file in the repository root and set the `TEST_REPOSITORY_URL` variable to the repository created in step 1.
3. Run the test script with `bash test.sh`.
4. The test files are available in the folder `test`. There is also a debug log there.
5. To exit the test and delete all files, press any key in the terminal.
6. After the test, delete the GitHub repository.
   The test needs a fresh repository because it uses tags to determine the next version and creates a new tag for the new version,
   so if the repository already has tags, the output version is not the one expected in the test script.
